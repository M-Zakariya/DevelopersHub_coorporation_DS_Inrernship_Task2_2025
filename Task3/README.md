                            ARIMA
                            Prophet
                            XGBoost

                    Evaluation & Visualization

                    Insights

**Results and findings**:

                        Our analysis compared ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost for short-term household energy forecasting.

                        XGBoost delivered the most accurate results, closely tracking actual energy usage and effectively capturing short-term fluctuations as well                         as daily and weekly patterns.

                        Prophet outperformed ARIMA, modeling seasonality and trends better, but still lagged in short-term precision.

                        ARIMA provided a reasonable baseline but struggled with sudden variations in consumption.
                        
**Key Insight**: For practical forecasting of household energy consumption, XGBoost is the most reliable model due to its ability to learn                              complex time-based patterns. Prophet remains valuable for interpretability, while ARIMA can serve as a simple benchmark.

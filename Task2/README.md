**Task 2**: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

**Task objective**:
                    Cluster customers based on spending habits and propose marketing strategies tailored to each
                    segment.

**My approach**:
                  Dataset Loading
                  EDA
                  Visualization
                  K-mean Clustring
                  PCA & t-SNE for Clusters Visualization
                  Marketing Strategies by Segment (k=6)

**Result And findings**:

**Interpretaions:**

Cluster 0 → Older (avg ~56), middle income, moderate spending.

Cluster 1 → Young adults (~33), high income, very high spending (your premium/high-value customers).

Cluster 2 → Very young (~25), low income, but high spending (price-sensitive, impulsive buyers).

Cluster 3 → Young (~26), medium income, moderate spending (average customers).

Cluster 4 → Middle-aged (~44), high income, very low spending (wealthy but not engaged).

Cluster 5 → Middle-aged (~45), low income, very low spending (budget-conscious, least valuable).
